## **Task 1**

```
Create a script that finds in the /proc directory all processes started by a given user (the user's uid
is given as the first command line argument). Print the number of files opened by this process. The results
are output to the console in the form: process pid, number of files. You cannot use the ps, top and similar
commands. Information about the user uid for a running process (program) is located in the /proc/pid/status
file (you can take the first value in the line as the user uid: “Uid: *** *** *** ***“). Files opened by
a process (program) - in /proc/pid/fd/.
